This project implements a small part of an online sales system (such as Amazon.com).
The current project is concerned only with customer comments for sales items. It contains
code to create, store, show and manipulate customer comments. 

Testing for the project is done for all of the public methods in SalesItemClass (except getName, getPrice, showInfo, SalesItem). 
Two methods downvote and getRating were tested in the Comment class.
How to run this project:
Right-click on the green test classes and choose Test All from the pop-up menue to test all methods. 
Choose the method you want to test and click click it if you want to see results for an individual method. 
See the testing plans for the project in a separate PDF file "TestPlan-g-15.pdf".
